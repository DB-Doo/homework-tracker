## Overview
The Homework Tracker is a web-based application designed to help students keep track of their homework assignments. Using an intuitive calendar interface, users can easily add, view, and manage their upcoming homework deadlines.

## Features
* Calendar View: Displays a monthly calendar where users can view the days marked with homework assignments.

* Add Assignments: Users can add homework assignments, specifying the title, details, and due date.

* View Daily Assignments: By clicking on a specific day, users can view all the homework assignments due on that day.


## needs fixing
* if assignment only has numbers or special characters then display homework window wont pop up for that day its assigned if theres nothing else there, item doesnt populate, cant delete it.
* the x button on homework display isnt showing up properly next to each item in the list
* todays assignments dont show up in upcoming list ////
* notes dont show up on upcoming list
* if you change date in notes to invalid date the whole item dissapears



## Improvement ideas
* when I click on a day I have option to add new assignment directly to the homework display

* if i edit due date in upcoming assignments it checks whether its a valid date. if not prompt user to enter a correct date

* stacked red indicators if theres more than 1 assignment due on single day
